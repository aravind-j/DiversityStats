Description: Provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing diversity from 
    frequency/abundance count data. Implements a wide range of classical and 
    entropy-based diversity indices, including Berger-Parker, Simpson (and 
    related variants), Shannon, Brillouin, McIntosh, Margalef, Menhinick and 
    Smith-Wilson. Supports permutation-based hypothesis tests for comparing 
    groups with respect to diversity (global and pairwise comparisons), as well 
    as confidence interval estimation using multiple bootstrap methods. 
    Includes functionality for generating diversity profiles based on 
    parametric families such as Hill numbers, Rényi entropy, and Tsallis 
    entropy. The methods are applicable to ecological community data (species 
    abundance counts) and genetic or phenotypic class frequency data.
